## Contributing

The project is in maintenance mode, meaning, changes are driven by contributed patches.
There is otherwise no active development or roadmap for this project. It is "DIY".

Only proposed changes in the form of a pull request are likely to be acted on, but,
these will be acted on promptly.

### Questions

Questions should be asked on the mailing list:
https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/zxing

### Feature Requests

Feature requests are generally not accepted and may be closed if nobody acts on them.
Feature requests with a pull request may be accepted. When in doubt, discuss on the
mailing list first.

### Bug Reports

Bug reports must have enough detail to understand and reproduce the problem. Inadequate
bug reports will be closed with a request for more information.

Bug reports without an associated pull request are not likely to be addressed, but will be
left open for some time to see if anyone can contribute a solution. However, bug reports
with a pull request are likely to be merged promptly.
